Using Yolo CNN to analyze rodent social behavior

We use [Yolo v3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) [(code)]( https://www.github.com/chen42/darkRodents/) to analyze rodent social behavior. Videos are recorded using a Raspberry Pi camera. Five body parts are tracked. Multiple freely moving rats can be analyzed.
